<p><h2 class="header-text">Current Quality of Life</h2></p>

          
  <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong>  It is not unusual for several years to have passed from the time a person filled out their living will and when it is first needed to help decide how to treat them medically.  Sometimes a person’s quality of life may have changed significantly over that time.  If their quality of life has gotten significantly worse they may now not want to be treated as aggressively as they indicated in their living will.</p>

  <p>While a person should ideally complete a new living will any time their quality of life changes significantly most people forget to do so. If you have been hospitalized and your surrogate and doctors are using your living will to help determine what care you would want it could be helpful to them if they knew that your quality of life was now much worse than when you completed your living will.</p>
